# **Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!**
This repository showcases a curated selection of SQL projects that highlight my technical skills, analytical thinking, and passion for working with data. Each example reflects my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and insightful code—core strengths I’m building as I pursue a career in data analysis.

 Whether you're here to explore best practices or evaluate potential, I invite you to take a look around. If you have any questions or would like to discuss my work further, I’d be delighted to connect!
